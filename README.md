Project Student Manager System
==============================

This project is a simple implementation of a Student Manager System using C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system allows users to add new students, courses, and scores, as well as display and export data in CSV format.

Requirements
------------

-   C++ compiler (supporting C++11)
-   Git
-   Any text editor (Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, etc.)

How to use
----------

1.  Clone the repository:

    

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TrungNgoVan/Project_SMSystem.git
```

2.  Compile the program using your preferred C++ compiler (e.g. g++):

```bash
g++ *.cpp -o main.exe
```

3.  Run the program:

```bash
main.exe
```

4.  Follow the instructions in the terminal to use the system.

Features
--------

-   Add new students, courses, and scores
-   Display data (students, courses, scores) in a table
-   Import, export data to CSV format

Code structure
--------------
- Wait a minute ...

Limitations
-----------

This implementation is a simple one and has several limitations:

-   No input validation or error handling (e.g. duplicate student IDs)
-   Limited functionality (e.g. no editing or deleting of records)
-   Only supports a fixed set of courses (MTH10405, MTH00012, MTH00108)

Future improvements
-------------------

-   Add input validation and error handling
-   Implement editing and deleting of records
-   Allow users to add and remove courses dynamically
-   Support a wider range of courses and grading systems
